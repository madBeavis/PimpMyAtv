Files related to leveling up accounts

To make the most of MAD, your accounts need to be at level 30.  The following is a quick rundown of what an account needs to be levelwise for modes:

1. Monster scanning - you can have any level account find monsters, but to get the IV of it the account needs to be level 30 or higher.  Lower than 30 and MAD will ignore the IV data from the encounter.
2. Raids - any account over level 5 will work, which is the level you need to be to examine gyms
3. Quests - should be level 30 or higher.  Some rewards like monsters will be the same for all accounts that spin the stop for the quest.  However, say a level 5 was spun a stop that should be ultra balls, but since they can't get them based on their level the rewards would be erroneous.

# How to make accounts

Level 30 accounts are created with MAD in what is called level mode.  This just goes around spinning stops.  You will need to spin just under 8000 stops to get an account to 30 if you don't use lucky eggs.  Don't worry, set things up correctly and MAD will handle things for you.

There appears to be a stop spun limit per week of 7k.  As shown by the math provided by eevvee33 @ https://discordapp.com/channels/465247740553592832/465247740553592835/669635127156146178 breaks down why your worker will get stuck at about level 29.8 and hang.  Simply rest it for a few days and finish it off.  The math is shown as follows:

spin a new pokestop: 250xp
spin 10th new pokestop in a row: 500xp
daily spin streak (days 1-6): 500xp
daily spin streak (day 7): 2000xp
This explains why we hit level 29.8 after spinning 7000 stops:
6300 new stops (250xp)
 700 new stops as 10th new stop in a row (500xp)
   6 daily streaks (500xp)
   1 7th day streak (2000xp)
6300*250 + 700*500 + 6*500 + 2000 = 1930000 xp (level 29.8)
